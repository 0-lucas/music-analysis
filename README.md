## Warning for the statisticians
Even though I've applied some significance tests, most of what I used could be considered wrong if compared to the "correct statistical approach", like disregarding Linear Regression's assumptions and applying it either way.

I'm forecasting, not applying causality methods, and forecasting methods are determined by the ones that work, not the one statistically correct.
